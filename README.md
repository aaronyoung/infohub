Project: InfoHub
Author: Aaron Young

Description: This is just a basic website I'm making to train myself in different techniques and technologies. I thought I'd at least make it useful in some way by making it a listing of some of the resources I've found online while teaching myself web development skills. None of the sites linked to are my own unless otherwise stated.

If somehow you've stumbled across this project and you actually find it useful, then good for you. It's just going to be basic learner code, so nothing is proprietary here but my own name. I can't promise that anything here is done to best practices, because that's one of the things I'm trying to learn, so take what you see with that disclaimer in mind.
