	<h2>Other Projects</h2>
	
	<p>There's nothing here just yet, but this is where I plan to index and keep track of my other projects as I create them. A lot of them will probably be different WordPress sites. I want to try putting together sites for different use cases such as a podcast, a photographer's portfolio, a band site, an online doodad store and more as I think of them and have the time.</p>
