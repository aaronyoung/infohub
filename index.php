<p>Not really sure what I should put in the <code>&ltnav&gt</code> tags of this page at this point. I suppose it might be good to have the links here in a list rather than at the top in a nav, since this will likely become a growing list and doesn't really need to be pretty or anything.</p>

<p> I guess one thing I could do is have a page with a list of sites I'm working on and some other pages with lists of resources to help keep me organized, since my chrome bookmarks are kind of a nightmare. Something like My Sites, Wordpress Plugins, Tutorials, Dev Environment links, Git Resources, Blogs, Competitor Sites, etc.</p>
